A Deep Learning-driven Smart Wireless Communication System

Different machine learning models to detect the type of modulation techniques used to deliver a radio frequency signal from the transmitter to the reciever.

After usig KNN,linear SVM,Non linea SVM, we will find that the best model with the highest accuracy from non linear SVM model.
